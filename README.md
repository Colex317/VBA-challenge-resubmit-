VBA Scripting to Analyze Generated Stock Market Data

Project Description:
  
  Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
  - The ticker symbol
  - Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  - The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  - The total stock volume of the stock. 
  - Add functionality to the script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". 
  - Use conditional formatting that will highlight positive changes in green and negative changes in red.
  - Ensure the script acts the same on every sheet.
